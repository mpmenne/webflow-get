Using available data and frameworks published by Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, Andrea and Adam created a holistic picture of the affordable housing landscape and needs in Rochester. “Although learning on the job was difficult at first, I was continually supported by the city employees in Rochester and by the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative. Because of them, I was able to complete an incredibly complex data task in just six weeks,” Adam said. He found that the housing supply could be reworked to better accommodate the population in need of affordable housing by increasing the stock of 1-bedroom apartments. Their findings gave city officials valuable insights as they began to rewrite the city’s zoning code, and it was recently cited by Mayor Warren in her State of the City address.</p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="slider-collection-item w-dyn-item"><div class="slider-collection-box"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/611129efe56387fa8c3b29af_Group%20430%20(1).png" loading="lazy" width="348" alt="Mock website of a mayor&#x27;s dashboard" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 348px, (max-width: 991px) 38vw, (max-width: 1439px) 27vw, 324.796875px" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/611129efe56387fa8c3b29af_Group%20430%20(1)-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/611129efe56387fa8c3b29af_Group%20430%20(1).png 696w" class="student-image"/><h4 class="text-white small-margin-bottom-10">Lauren Lombardo, MPP 2021</h4><div class="byline text-white weight-400">Lincoln, Nebraska</div><div class="white-rich-text w-richtext"><p>Lauren Lombardo, HKS MPP 2021, worked closely with the mayor’s office in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, to improve the city’s use of data and performance evaluation in policymaking. Lauren found that the city’s existing system, LNKStat, was outdated and had been abandoned by the intended users. After 20 interviews with stakeholders, Lauren developed a new metrics toolkit to be used alongside policymaking that will provide a guide for identifying key performance indicators and monitoring metrics during policy development. Her solution ensures a flexible system that can adapt more readily than static metrics. In addition, Lauren scoped and tested a data dashboard for city officials that would make data more accessible to the public and promote data-driven governance. Lauren said of her experience, “During a time of pandemic and social unrest, my summer fellowship with Lincoln came with unexpected challenges and unanticipated rewards. I learned the importance of making data accessible and flexible and saw first-hand how to impact organizational change within governing institutions.”</p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="slider-collection-item w-dyn-item"><div class="slider-collection-box"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/610d4aa9554ab09dee7966c4_Group%20553%20(1).png" loading="lazy" width="348" alt="Protest in Chicago in the wake of the murder of George Floyd" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 348px, (max-width: 991px) 38vw, (max-width: 1439px) 27vw, 324.796875px" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/610d4aa9554ab09dee7966c4_Group%20553%20(1)-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/610d4aa9554ab09dee7966c4_Group%20553%20(1).png 696w" class="student-image"/><h4 class="text-white small-margin-bottom-10">Zoe Bulger, MPP 2021</h4><div class="byline text-white weight-400">Chicago, Illinois</div><div class="white-rich-text w-richtext"><p>Zoe Bulger, HKS MPP 2021, started her fellowship in the Chicago Mayor’s Office of Equity and Racial Justice days after protests had erupted across the city in response to the murder of George Floyd and legacy of police brutality, state violence, and racism. “While my work for the summer was focused broadly on racial equity in response to COVID-19, it was clear that Chicago needed a way forward through the trauma caused by systemic racism and the pandemic – it needed to heal,” she said. Working closely with Chicago’s Chief Equity Officer, Zoe engaged a range of stakeholders to explore strategies for healing and identify work already underway in the city. She also examined cases of reconciliation in other cities in the US and abroad. At the end of the fellowship, she submitted a proposal for how Chicago can launch a city-wide healing journey and drive transformation for racial equity.</p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="slider-collection-item w-dyn-item"><div class="slider-collection-box"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/610d4a7ca6916f26d149e7b9_Group%20552%20(1).png" loading="lazy" width="348" alt="A crowd gathers for peaceful protest held in Oklahoma City" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 348px, (max-width: 991px) 38vw, (max-width: 1439px) 27vw, 324.796875px" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/610d4a7ca6916f26d149e7b9_Group%20552%20(1)-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/60f998ee966fd623d55b7838/610d4a7ca6916f26d149e7b9_Group%20552%20(1).png 696w" class="student-image"/><h4 class="text-white small-margin-bottom-10">Andrew Loh, MPP 2022, MBA 2022</h4><div class="byline text-white weight-400">Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</div><div class="white-rich-text w-richtext"><p>Andrew Loh, HKS MPP 2022 and Stanford Graduate School of Business MBA 2022, worked with the Oklahoma City Mayor’s Office to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 in the city and strengthen civilian oversight of the police force.

After 20 interviews with stakeholders, Lauren developed a new metrics toolkit to be used alongside policymaking that will provide a guide for identifying key performance indicators and monitoring metrics during policy development. Her solution ensures a flexible system that can adapt more readily than static metrics. In addition, Lauren scoped and tested a data dashboard for city officials that would make data more accessible to the public and promote data-driven governance. Lauren said of her experience, “During a time of pandemic and social unrest, my summer fellowship with Lincoln came with unexpected challenges and unanticipated rewards.

Using available data and frameworks published by Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, Andrea and Adam created a holistic picture of the affordable housing landscape and needs in Rochester. “Although learning on the job was difficult at first, I was continually supported by the city employees in Rochester and by the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative. Because of them, I was able to complete an incredibly complex data task in just six weeks,” Adam said. He found that the housing supply could be reworked to better accommodate the population in need of affordable housing by increasing the stock of 1-bedroom apartments.

However, if the fellow may require access to a secure city application, the city will work with that fellow and Bloomberg Harvard to make sure the fellow has the appropriate setup to host city applications.</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: Will the cohort be engaging in activities together? </p><p class="text-white">A: Yes, Bloomberg Harvard fellows will meet regularly to get to know one another and build a community of practice that will include problem-solving collectively and with Bloomberg Harvard staff, engaging in professional development workshops designed to fill gaps in fellows’ skillset going into their fellowships, as well as meet for virtual happy hours.  Examples of previous professional development workshops include sessions such as “Making Yourself Useful” with David Eaves; “Survey Design” with Bloomberg Harvard staff; and “City Hall 101” with former Mayor Sly James and former Los Angeles Chief Data Officer Sari Ladin-Sienne.</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: May international students apply?</p><p class="text-white">A: Most international students can apply, but you may need to check with the International Office ​here​ to discuss your specific visa situation. Note: Harvard University, not the city, will be your employer and Harvard will pay you for the fellowship. </p><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: May undergraduates apply? <br/></p><p class="text-white">A: The summer fellowship is only open to graduate students.</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: Do I choose my own faculty advisor?  </p><p class="text-white">A: We will assign you a faculty advisor as well as an Initiative staff “champion” to serve as your advocate within our program.</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: When is the application period and deadline?  </p><p class="text-white">A: Applications will be live on February 4, and applications will close on February 12.</p><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: Is this open to students graduating in May 2021? What about if I graduated in 2020 or earlier? </p><p class="text-white">A: You can apply if you are graduating in May 2021, but not if you graduated in 2020 or earlier.  Students who started Harvard graduate courses and then went on a leave of absence fall 2020 or spring 2021 (or both) and are retuning fall 2021 are eligible. Students who deferred this academic year and will not start at Harvard until fall 2021 are not eligible this summer (but would be eligible summer 2022).</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: How are participating cities selected? </p><p class="text-white">A: We select from cities that are part of our current cohort or alumni cohorts. </p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: Where can I see the list of participating cities and projects? </p><p class="text-white">A: https://www.cityleadership.harvard.edu/student-fellowship</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: How does city placement/choice work? </p><p class="text-white">A: In the application, you will be asked to make a case for your top three choices. In the application, you may use up to 125 words ​per project to explain your interest.</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: How integrated are fellows with their government teams? </p><p class="text-white">A: We ask cities to integrate fellows with their teams as much as possible. In remote fellowships, fellows and city supervisors will need to make an extra effort.</p></div><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: From which Schools at Harvard do you typically attract candidates?  </p><p class="text-white">A: We love to see a diversity in programs and Schools represented. Prior candidates have attended HKS, HSPH, HBS, HGSE, the Extension School, and the GSD.</p><div class="question"><p class="bold-paragraph text-white">Q: Have any past fellows been selected without prior government experience? </p><p class="text-white">A: Yes! We accept fellows with all types of backgrounds - public, private, and non-profit.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer id="footer" class="footer wf-section"><div class="footer-container"><div class="footer-flex-container"><div class="div-block-31"><a href="/" aria-label="Return to Home" class="footer-logo-link"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60e48ce4d1f3d860bc9d5524_Bloomberg_Harvard_Logo_KO_DIGITAL-Horizontal%20copy.png" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 340px, (max-width: 1439px) 27vw, 340px" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60e48ce4d1f3d860bc9d5524_Bloomberg_Harvard_Logo_KO_DIGITAL-Horizontal%2520copy-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60e48ce4d1f3d860bc9d5524_Bloomberg_Harvard_Logo_KO_DIGITAL-Horizontal%2520copy-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60e48ce4d1f3d860bc9d5524_Bloomberg_Harvard_Logo_KO_DIGITAL-Horizontal%2520copy-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60e48ce4d1f3d860bc9d5524_Bloomberg_Harvard_Logo_KO_DIGITAL-Horizontal%20copy.png 1969w" loading="lazy" alt="Logo of Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative" class="footer-image"/></a><div class="copy">© 2021 The President and Fellows of Harvard College</div></div><div class="div-block-32"><h2 class="footer-heading">Follow the Initiative</h2><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="/subscribe" class="footer-link">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href="/contact" class="footer-link">Contact Us</a></li></ul><div class="footer-social"><a aria-label="Follow us on LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bloombergharvard/" target="_blank" class="link-block-3 w-inline-block"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60f59cb75748442c56eae151_linkedin.png" loading="lazy" width="40" alt="LinkedIn Logo" class="image-63"/></a><a aria-label="Follow us on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/bhcityleaders" target="_blank" class="w-inline-block"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/60f59cb7c7a8447cbb8c33e7_twitter.png" loading="lazy" width="40" alt="Twitter Logo" class="image-64"/></a></div></div><div class="div-block-33"><h2 class="footer-heading">Website</h2><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/digital-accessibility-policy" target="_blank" class="footer-link">Digital Accessibility</a></li></ul></div><div class="div-block-34"><h2 class="footer-heading">Security &amp; Brand</h2><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://gdpr.harvard.edu/eeaprivacydisclosures" target="_blank" class="footer-link">EU/EEA Privacy Disclosure</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://assets.website-files.com/60e48cc9205f7401d5bbe0b6/js/bhcli-new-site.4b1f94c58.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--><style>
